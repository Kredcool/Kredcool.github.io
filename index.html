			<h3>Why this exists</h3>

			<!--text-->
			<p>
				This website is to house all of my destiny 2 solo runs. Please
				excuse the simplicity I'm not a graphic designer. Also don't
				look at the code, this is my first time doing HTML stuff its
				awful. Hover on the header to options for loadouts or the runs
				themselves. The recordings were in long sessions the only runs
				that have been edited to be just them are the final successful
				runs to allow for quick viewing. The loadouts will only show the
				successful run and not previous runs.
